&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My skillset includes in-demand languages like **Python**, **Java**, and **Javascript**. I can code in less abstacted languages like **C++**, and have even dabbled into the grassroots of programming by learning basics of **Intel** ***x86-64*** **assembly**; providing an insight into the working of our systems that most programming languages abstract to obscurity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created several static webpages, with sufficient use of CSS. I have repositories devoted to Data Structures and Algorithms, and have done projects in Java regarding noise generation and image processing, as well as made games incorporating my own physics engine.
