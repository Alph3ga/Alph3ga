## Hey this is Alph3ga

- I am Akashneel Raychaudhuri, a 17 year old student who codes as a hobby
- I mainly code in Java, but my repos will mostly be static webpages using HTML, CSS and JS since I use Github pages to host my web projects

*Since I only use this as a hobby, my code may be a bit messy at times, but if you're interested, I hope you can make sense of it!*
