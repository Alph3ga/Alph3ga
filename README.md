# This is me

### :wave: I am a 18 year old who loves to code  
### :bust_in_silhouette: Currently, I am a student at IIT Kharagpur
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My skillset includes in-demand languages like **Python**, **Java**, and **Javascript**. I can code in less abstacted languages like **C++**, and have even dabbled into the grassroots of programming by learning basics of **Intel** ***x86-64*** **assembly**; providing me an insight into the working of our systems that most programming languages abstract to obscurity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Static webpages are a part of several of my projects, showcasing not only Javascript programming, but also sufficient use of CSS. I have a repository devoted to Data Structures and Algorithms, in both C++ and Python. I have done projects in Java regarding noise generation and image processing, as well as made games incorporating my own physics engine.
